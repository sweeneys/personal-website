In first year I was awarded an academic scholarship from UCD that pays my fees, 
gives me guaranteed
half price on-campus accommodation and means that I can claim to be part of a 
community of only around
150 students from all of UCD that have shown 'exceptional' academic abilities.
But with one caveat, to retain the scholarship I have to keep my GPA > 3.68 for
the duration of my time in college. That GPA roughly translates to getting at 
least an average grade of an A- across all subjects.

This year was the first year that I genuinely was really worried that I might fall at
that hurdle - I hope that doesn't seem like me being being overly self-confident, 
to be entirely honest I really don't think it's that difficult
to keep grades above an A- in engineering, it's mostly a matter of just putting the
time in.

Back in August of last year I pleaded with Dr. David Timoney, the head of the 
MEng in Energy Systems Engineering in UCD (and a great guy!) to let me take an 
out of programme
10 credit subject called Weather & Climate which is offered by the UCD School of Maths.
 In UCD the way credits 
work is that students take 30 credits per semester, so the subject would count
for 1/3 of my overall workload. And he let me take it, success. 

Taking the subject was a very risky move from the point
of view of protecting my <s>first-born-child</s> GPA. School of Maths subjects
are taboo as they are out of the comfort realm of engineering. 
I wanted to take the subject to:

1. Get an understanding of basic atmospheric processes that govern the weather

2. Learn about weather forecasting methods and how they could also apply to forecasting
the behaviour of other dynamical, chaotic systems

The subject ended up taking up about 4 times as much time as any other subject I've taken
in UCD over the last 4 years. **Disclaimer**: since it was a 10 credit subject and normal
subjects are 5 credits it only took up twice as much of my time on a time vs. credit basis. 

As part of the subject, I went on a weekend field trip to Valentia Observatory in 
Cahersiveen, Co. Kerry 
where I met and found out about some of the great work that Met Ã‰ireann 
researchers do in monitoring ozone, NO<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> etc. I also
hiked the Beentee loop where I took measurements of weather parameters like
temperature and wind speed
with weather instruments like psychrometers. The data was later
analysed to see how it varied with altitude/time/instrument etc.

I learned about weather data analysis, literature reviews, report writing, delivering
presentations and honed my skills using two tools - python (programming language) 
and linux (OS).

Last semester my '9am-5pm's were spent in the engineering building, my '5pm-11pm's in 
the library and a larger proportion than ever of my '11pm-4am's
at my desk at home. I had lectures and 
computer labs to go to, journal papers to read, data that I had no idea how to analyse, 
python to figure out, presentations to prepare,
reports to write, figures to generate, tests to study for and extra reading to do. 
And I had some work to do for my other 4 subjects too.

I ended up getting an A- in the 10 credit subject which wasn't great
considering how much time and effort I put into it. I also didn't do as well as
I normally would have done in my other 4 subjects (I was still doing continuous 
assessment work for the 10 credit subject until a couple of days before exams started).

Taking a step back - the UCD Horizons programme allows 
students to take two 'elective' subjects per year,
which can be in-programme modules to *deepen your learning* or
modules from outside your programme to *broaden your horizons*.

Over the years I've taken elective subjects in macroeconomics, banking, robotics
management studies and french all of which have given me valuable
insights and new perspectives.
The fallacy is that I've actually consistently got worse grades in my elective 
subjects than my core in-programme modules. 

I recently worked harder, learned more and got the worst set of grades that I have
ever got. What that means for me is that I probably won't get my first choice for my masters
project next year (allocated based on GPA), I might not even be considered for 
some PhD programmes I was considering applying for and I probably won't be selected for
any academic awards from UCD at the awards ceremony this year. Somehow I had done 
enough to crawl over the line of keeping my GPA over the 3.68 mark and keeping
the scholarship.

Not all credits are created equally and there is such a thing as *easy-A* subjects. 
Taking that 10 credit subject very
nearly cost me financial security next year but yet taking it was probably the best 
decision I could have made in terms of learning relevant things for my degree 
and useful skills for my future career.

I'm a bit twisted at heart so I do see the funny side in all of this. It's not like
it would have been the end of the world if I had lost the scholarship. The real point
I'm trying to get to is probably aimed at anyone that has a decision to make on the
basis of GPA. GPAs are such a seemingly great metric to use to assess people for so
many different things. They are entirely clear-cut: if someone's GPA
is higher than someone else's then they get the job/award/awe from their peers.

In the last couple of years, particularly since having studied abroad in Australia,
I've 

I have so much admiration for people that are exceptional in sports, music, people 
that do crazy amounts of voluntary work. GPAs don't tell the full story.
