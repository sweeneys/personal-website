In my first year at university (UCD) I was awarded an academic scholarship with a lot of perks
but the double-edged sword is that in order to retain the scholarship I have to keep my 
GPA > 3.68 for <!--more-->
the duration of my time in college. That GPA roughly translates to getting at 
least an average grade of an A- across all subjects.

This year was the first year (out of four) that I genuinely was really worried that I might fall at
that hurdle - I hope that doesn't seem like me being being overly self-confident, 
to be entirely honest I really don't think it's that difficult
to keep grades above an A- in engineering, it's mostly a matter of just putting the
time in.

Back in August of last year I convinced Dr. David Timoney, the head of the 
MEng in Energy Systems Engineering in UCD (and a great guy!) to let me take an 
out of programme
10 credit subject called Weather & Climate which is offered by the UCD School of Maths. 
In UCD the way credits 
work is that students take 30 credits per semester, so the subject counted
for 1/3 of my overall workload last semester.

Taking a subject from outside my main area of study that was offered by a different school
was a very risky move from the point
of view of protecting my <s>first-born-child</s> GPA. 
I wanted to take the subject to:

1. Gain an understanding of the processes that govern the behaviour of the weather

2. Learn about weather forecasting methods and if they could also apply to forecasting
the behaviour of other dynamical, chaotic systems

The subject ended up taking up about 5 times as much time as any other subject I've taken
in UCD over the last 4 years. Here are some details:

- As part of the subject, I went on my first ever weekend field trip which was to Valentia Observatory in 
Cahersiveen, Co. Kerry 
where I met and found out about some of the great work that Met Ã‰ireann 
researchers do in monitoring ozone, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>4</sub> etc. I also
hiked the Beentee loop where I took measurements of weather parameters like
temperature and wind speed
with funny looking weather instruments like psychrometers. The data was later
analysed to see how it varied with altitude/time/instrument etc.

- During the semester, I learned about weather data analysis, literature reviews (completely foreign to me), 
report writing, delivering presentations and honed my skills using two tools - python (programming language) 
and linux (OS).

- Last semester my "9am-5pm"s were spent in the engineering building, my "5pm-11pm"s in 
the library and a larger proportion than ever of my "11pm-4am"s
bent over my desk at home. I had lectures and 
computer labs to go to, journal papers to read, data that I had no idea how to analyse, 
python to figure out, presentations to prepare,
reports to write, figures to generate, tests to study for and extra reading to do. 
And I had some work to do for my other 4 subjects too.

**Figure that I produced for a project on ECMWF ensemble forecasting. Data is for Storm Barney
which hit Ireland in November 2015. Darker colours show how there is increasing uncertainty
in the weather forecast (mean sea level pressure) with increasing lead time.**

Anyway, after all the work and severe sleep deprivation, I ended up getting an A- in the subject 
which was barely adequate from the point of view of keeping my scholarship. 
I also did worse in my other subjects than I normally 
would have done (time pressure)
so my overall GPA just about got over the line to mean I could keep 
the scholarship. 

Taking that subject, will probably 
mean that I won't be allocated my first choice for my masters
project next year (based on GPA), I might not even be considered for 
some PhD programmes or graduate jobs and I probably won't 
be selected for
any academic awards from UCD at the awards ceremony this year, not to mention very nearly 
costing me financial security for the rest of my 
time in college. But yet taking it was probably the best 
decision I could have made in terms of learning relevant things for my degree 
and useful skills for my future career. 

**

Taking a step back - the UCD Horizons programme allows 
students to take two 'elective' subjects per year,
which can be in-programme modules to *deepen your learning* or
modules from outside your programme to *broaden your horizons*.

Taking myself as an example of an-ever-looking-to-broaden-my-horizons-type I've done my electives 
in subjects like macroeconomics, banking, robotics
management studies and french all of which have given me valuable
insights and new perspectives into different fields that were of interest to me.
The fallacy is that I've actually consistently got worse grades in my elective 
subjects than my core in-programme modules. I also know the reverse case to be
true for some people - that they would bank on their elective subjects to pull up their 
overall GPAs.

So what's going on?

Easy! Not all GPAs are created equally as there is such a thing as an "*easy-A*" subject
and there most definitely is such a thing as a "*not-easy-A*" subject. 

At first glance GPAs are such a seemingly great metric to use to assess students for so
many different things. They make decisions really easy: if my GPA
is higher than my friend's then I should get the job/award/awe.

However it's important to realise that GPAs don't tell the whole story. 

**Take home:** If ever in a position where a decision has to be made and it seems that GPA 
should be used as the sole criterion, it probably makes sense to delve a little
deeper. Maybe the A+ the candidate got in their elective in massage in first year is not the best indicator 
of their abilities as a software developer.
