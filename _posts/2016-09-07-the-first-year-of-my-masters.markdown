I spent a lot of time in the last week trying to decide which subjects I am going to study and what my year-long project
will be about for the second and final year of my masters degree in Energy Systems Engineering. 
Now seems like a fitting time to reflect on how the first year went.

I thought an interesting way to discuss this would be through photographs.

I was the partnerships manager this year for the Erasmus Student Network (ESN) in UCD. Through this opportunity I 
got to make new friends from all over the world while helping out some students that were new to the country and in need of
a friendly face - personal highlight being the 2 weekend trips to Belfast and Kerry where I was the group leader.

I travelled as much as I could - I got to travel to 8 countries and was delighted to catch up with some of my
best friends from when I studied abroad myself at the University of Melbourne in 2014. Photo below is from a 12 day trip to 
Norway in August 2016.

I graduated! I'm now the happy owner of a BSc in Electrical & Electronic Engineering

I am in the process of starting my first company as part of the EUXCEL virtual accelerator programme. I am working virtually with
a motivated, vision driven team located throughout Europe - we want to change the way that the world of work *works*.

I grew and maintained my network through participating in conferences like EUXCEL in Cartagena, Spain (to promote youth 
entrepreneurship)
and the IEEE Student & Young professionals congress in Canterbury, UK. I was also treasurer of the UCD Electrical & Electronic
Engineering society (Elecsoc) and IEEE UCD Student branch this year. Pictured below is the Elecsoc team with Dave Burke, the VP
of Engineering at Google.

I maintained my grades in university and I am on track to graduate with a first class honours degree. I could possibly
post a photo of UCD library here...but I'll refrain.

I bought my first bicycle (since childhood) and I've been cycling everywhere around Dublin and further afield since then. I
also bought my first camera which I'm still learning to use. Hint: photo not taken in Dublin.

I spent the last 8 months working with a company called EnerNOC which was my longest work experience to date. I worked as 
part of our global operations team and was responsible for executing high stress, time critical,
*dispatches* in demand response events from all over the world that had serious potential to impact company goals. The team
was the highlight for me - we had a driven, committed and capable team serviced by the inspirational and influential 
management style of one Mr. Tony Whittle.

I also organised and participated in Tough Mudder for the EnerNOC Dublin office - a great day out!

And got the opportunity to travel to company HQ over in Boston where most of the 1,500 global EnerNOC employees are based.

Throughout this year there were also huge personal & professional challenges that were made so much easier to work through by
having the support of my parents, family, friends & colleagues. I've learned so much from everyone and while I know that
this year will probably be the busiest of my life to date I really cannot wait to see what's coming 
and look forward to continuing to collaborate with a network of great people.
