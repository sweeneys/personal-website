Some poems that I wrote recently which all fall under the theme of "pushing boundaries".
<!--more-->

**Chasing** 

Chasing, always chasing, a dog \\
and his tail, circles, no, \\
not circles, straight lines, and \\
curvy lines, but trending upwards, \\
seemingly stochastically, dips \\
and troughs, functions, filters, \\
dark glasses and bright glasses, \\
colourful, flamboyant even. The \\
negatives, the circles, the tails, the \\
vultures, who try, to hold you back; \\
walk, they walk in circles, chasing \\
tails they can never catch, your tail, \\
you move it fast, you change direction. \\
They cannot catch you, you're \\
fast, and smart, and chased and\\
desperate.\\
But reaching, forwards, upwards.\\
Trending up, new dogs, \\
chasing circles, positive signs, negative \\
cosigns, negative signs, positive cosigns, \\
changing quadrants, chasing, you. \\
Jealousy, hypocrisy, unfulfilment. Why. \\
If they hesitate, you should stop, pause, and \\
help them, break out of the infinite \\
circle, show them the negatives, the positives, \\
stay on the positives, filter the negatives, a parabola! \\
Shifting trajectories, to infinity, together. Stronger, \\
reinforced, energised, together.

**Subscribed** 

Subscribed, to a set of \\
beliefs, a mission \\
statement, commandments, \\
Rules, that thou must \\
obey, or else. The rules, \\
superceding the thoughts, \\
after all, the rules came \\
first, they are established, \\
they must be right, surely? 

Tolerance, for thoughts,\\
beyond the rules, is bounded, \\
or else. On the surface, \\
accepted, but, if thoughts \\
develop, that contradict the \\
rules, or worse, endanger them, the \\
thoughts must be crushed. 

Consequences are established, \\
to control the thoughts, to \\
ensure, that the rules prevail. \\
The fires of hell threaten, \\
prison threatens, social \\
conscience threatens. In a \\
world, where no rules exist, \\
there is anarchy, people, and \\
things, unsubscribed to a \\
set of commandments, of value \\
statements, of rules. Murder, \\
swearing and violence, evil runs \\
rampant. Sexualities, expressed; \\
thoughts, free; bellies, full; \\
identities, questioned; sleep-ins \\
on Sundays, or early mornings \\
to watch the sunrise, to indulge,\\
not guilty. But free, to choose, \\
to wander, to express, to push. \\
Hopefully, to help, to engage and \\
to love. Hopefully not to murder, \\
maybe some rules are useful. 

**Full Notebooks** 

Full notebooks, empty pockets, \\
racing minds, passing trains, \\
adolescents running, for the \\
train, they make it. Thoughts, \\
sights, smells, captured, in \\
notebooks, forever, until, the \\
notebook is full, and then \\
the thoughts, running, racing,\\
free, uncaptured, undocumented, \\
forgotten. Ink on paper, blue \\
ink, blue trains, and green.

Passing, passing, gone. The thoughts \\
remain, etched in ink, captured. \\
The mind racing, thoughts, that want, \\
to be, set free, but we don't let \\
them, or I don't let them, I \\
keep writing, sensibly, it helps me.

Organised, by virtue of their existence. No\\
longer free, captured, in ink, \\
but stuck? The thoughts, live \\
on, only captured, for a moment \\
in ink, the train is moving, to \\
the next station, the next stop, \\
the next notebook, and then, \\
free again, to roam, to race, \\
to wander, to discover. The man \\
next to me, does not write in \\
a notebook, but rather, he reads, \\
a newspaper, absorbing the \\
thoughts of others, that were \\
captured, in a moment, now \\
outdated, by who knows how \\
many stations. But the facts, \\
can never change, or can they? \\
Keep reading, find out more, \\
thinking, about the thoughts, the \\
time they were captured, not \\
letting them become your own, \\
but rather, letting them help you, \\
and your thoughts, to develop,\\
to run faster, to be more free. 

I'm on the train now. I'm moving \\
with my thoughts, in sync, to the \\
next station, and onwards.

**Gravity**

Gravity pushes downwards, \\
to earth, with force, \\
poorly understood, but \\
helpful, a constant, well, \\
almost. Depressing us, \\
limiting us, protecting us. 

Vertical limitations, but \\
horizontal is free!\\
Surely, that's enough. To wander, \\
in two dimensions, infinitely, \\
but not quite. Infinitely, \\
we circle, eventually, we \\
are back where we started, \\
where we have seen once \\
before, maybe more. But \\
vertically, we are, unlimited!

Infinitely unlimited, lost \\
in space and time, anonymous. \\
Unknown trajectories, unknown \\
futures, unknown gravities, and \\
maybe, if we travel far enough, \\
no gravity, no depression, \\
no limits, no protection, \\
finally free! But more \\
vulnerable than ever, infinitely \\
lost, infinitely unknown, \\
infinitely alone. Infinitesimally, \\
at one point, we could have turned \\
back, to known gravity, to home, \\
to abandon new heights, \\
to settle, to age, to protect \\
someone else.

**Heights**

Defined by sea level, \\
the moving, roaring alive \\
sea, that defines, the \\
heights, that we are. \\
Ebbs, crashes, falls, \\
smashing rocks, alive. \\
Roaring, angry, tall, and \\
growing. Fed, by the land, \\
and then the air, fed by us, \\
at heights defined by the sea. \\
Flames, burning, in our \\
engines, in our homes, in our \\
factories. Fire, fed by land, \\
and dinosaurs. Feeding \\
the air, feeding the sea, \\
defining new heights, \\
for the sea, and then for \\
the land, positive feedback, \\
terrifying, unstoppable, \\
or is it?

**Sunlight**

Sunlight, from the sky, all around me, \\
I see, at the station. \\
Responsible for all of the life, \\
and eventually all of the death. \\
The death, in the land, that we \\
use to live, is unsustainable. \\
Feeding life with death is, \\
foolish, damaging, damaging to \\
life. Sunlight is life, feeding \\
life with life is positive, uplifting,\\
alive. Death fires in our homes \\
must be extinguished, if we are, \\
to live, to flourish. Our lives, \\
fed by life, can then feed, \\
the air, the land, the oceans, \\
all that we know, giving. No longer \\
taking. The oceans settle, satisfied, \\
eating life, and not death, as \\
before. The new heights, are now reached \\
by us, fed by life.

**Pushing** 

Pushing, walking, wavering, \\
getting through, to you. Through \\
the people, the crowd, the gaps,\\
the light. Dancing, side-to-side, \\
enabled. Through. An objective, \\
in mind, reaching, always. A goal, \\
a long-term goal, pushing through \\
the people, stepping over them, \\
on them, bones breaking. Squashing, \\
squirming, underneath. You stand \\
triumphant, over them all. Standing \\
tall, your objective reached. Your \\
goal scored. But at what cost? 

The cost of pushing, the price, \\
the boundaries pushed, further \\
than ever before, learning, \\
further than you've ever been \\
before, but what about me? \\
And them? What's the cost?

The cost to the disabled? Those \\
that waited, hesitant, those that \\
did not push, those that let you \\
through, the disabled that \\
enabled you, did they get what \\
they deserved? or wanted? Pushed, \\
to let you through, so you could \\
see the light. 

Your family, your friends, the people \\
in the crowd, who are, content, or disabled? \\
Don't forget them, those that enabled you, \\
they're happy, and happy for you, are you?
