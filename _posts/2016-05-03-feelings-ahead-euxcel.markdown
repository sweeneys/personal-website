I found out a few weeks ago that I had been accepted to a program called EU-XCEL. It is an 
entrepreneurship program that "seeks to identify and empower aspiring young tech entrepreneurs
to become 'incubator ready' <!--more--> with real products of promise in the area of ICT". 
In this blog I will outline the structure of EU-XCEL, why I decided to apply
and what I hope to gain by participating.

**EU-XCEL Initiative**

There are three main stages to the EU-XCEL program:

1) Start-up Scrum

2) Virtual Accelerator

3) Challenge Final

6 one-week long start-up scrums will take place in cities across Europe in May and June 2016 
where 40ish young want-to-be entrepreneurs will come together for a week of intensive 
training which will be structured as a series of lectures and workshops.
I will be participating in the first scrum which will take place in Cartagena in the south-east of Spain from 
Sunday 8th May until Saturday 14th May.

Participants in the scrum are from throughout Europe and come from many different fields of study 
like economics, science, marketing, engineering and management studies. 

The scrum will lead directly into the virtual accelerator stage where I will work as part of a team with 2 or 3 others
(from the scrum) over the course of 14 weeks to develop an idea to the point that it will be a fully researched, tested
and market-ready start-up in time for the challenge final which will take place in Munich in October 2016.

In the past I wondered what I would do if I decided I was going to start a business of my own.
I think I would be relatively successful at the research and testing stages as they are things that I have experience 
in from my studies and from my work experience. 

However, I was accutely aware that there was a lot that I didn't know about the stage in between having the 
"big idea" and having a successful company. I have never had any formal education in topics like project management, 
business models, business strategy, business financing etc. and I felt that this information gap would cause a delay in 
developing my idea.

The program will enable me to learn about those topics in an applied way with definite goals and milestones throughout 
the process which will help to keep me on track and focused.

By the end of the scrum and 14-week virtual accelerator I aim to be confident that I know what I need to know if / when
I have an idea some day that I wish to develop into a business.
