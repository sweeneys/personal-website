I was successful in my application to study abroad at the University of Melbourne, Australia
for 1 semester of my undergraduate degree. 

I spent July 2014-November 2014 studying at the university and seeing what Melbourne had 
to offer (a lot!). I then travelled throughout Australia and New Zealand from December 2014
- January 2015.
