title: Universitas 21 Summer School
---

In July 2014 I represented my university at an international event at the 
University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.

The summer school was about "Smart Cities" and 5 different strands relating
to smart cities were considered including connectivity, resilience, inclusiveness,
healthiness and beauty.

I was involved in a team project which proposed a solution relating to the importance of
and efficient use of public space in future cities as population densities rise.

***More coming soon.***
