title: All Ireland Scholarship
---
I was awarded an All Ireland Scholarship on the basis of my exam results up to entering 
university.

The scholarship aims to reward students who have shown determination to reach high
academic achievements despite coming from underdeveloped socio-economic areas.

I am from a very rural area near the very northern tip of Ireland with very poor infrastructure
and a real shortage of investment.
