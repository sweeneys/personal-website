The UCD Ad Astra Academy is a scholarship programme in UCD that aims to recognise the 
talents of "exceptional students" in the areas of academia, sports and performing arts.

I was awarded a place in the UCD Ad Astra Academic Programme on the basis of my
exam results when I left school. I have retained my place in the Ad Astra Academy every year
since then based on my academic achievements in university.

The Ad Astra Academy aims to build a community of motivated individuals that want to affect 
real progress in the world.
