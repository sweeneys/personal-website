title: Energy Needs Ireland
---

Over the summer of 2013 I participated in an undergraduate,
interdisciplinary research project with 20 other students from universities throughout
Ireland. 

The group researched issues relating to the *Smart Grid*.

I was involved in research, data analysis, report writing, presentations and finance.

We published a report "Participating in Ireland's Smart Energy Future" which outlined
our main recommendations which can be found on our [website](http://eni.ucd.ie/?page_id=36){:target="_blank"}
