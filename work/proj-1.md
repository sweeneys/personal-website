Over the summer of my second last year in secondary school I put a project together for a competition called Smart Class which was sponsored by [Intel Ireland](http://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/homepage.html){:target="_blank"}, the [Educational Company of Ireland](https://www.edco.ie){:target="_blank"} and [Steljes](http://www.steljes.com){:target="_blank"}, and in the end the entry won the whole competition which I was/am delighted about.

I'm working on figuring out how to upload my submission for the competition to this site but in the mean time why not check out some of the things other people had to say about my entry!
