<p>Over the summer of my second last year in secondary school I put a project together for a competition called Smart Class which was sponsored by <a href="http://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/homepage.html" target="_blank">Intel Ireland</a>, the <a href="https://www.edco.ie" target="_blank">Educational Company of Ireland</a> and <a href="http://www.steljes.com" target="_blank">Steljes</a>, and in the end the entry won the whole competition which I was/am delighted about.</p>

<p>Check out some of the things other people had to say about my entry:</p>

<p>“A student’s vision brings national honours to Loreto, Milford” - <a href="http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/news/donegal-news/37634/A-student-s-vision-brings-national.html" target="_blank">Donegal Democrat</a></p>

<p>“Shaun Sweeney’s hard work, dedication and talent is truly admirable. He has secured a world-class learning environment for the incoming first years and he should be extremely proud of himself.” - <a href="https://www.fiannafail.ie/mcconalogue-congratulates-loreto-milford-on-smart-class-success/" target="_blank">Charlie McConalogue, Fianna Fáil TD</a></p>

<p>“All first-year pupils at the school will now get laptop computers after an entry by 5th year pupil Shaun Sweeney won the SmartClass competition” - <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/eggs-thrown-at-taoiseach-s-car-in-donegal-1.523006" target="_blank">Irish Times</a></p>
