<p>I am currently partnerships manager of the UCD Erasmus Student Network (ESN).
We are the student society that organises events for incoming exchange, study
abroad and erasmus students to help them to settle in to Ireland and make the most
of their time here. These events include weekend trips away, day trips and regular 
weekly events like afternoon tea.</p>
