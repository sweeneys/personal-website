<p>I was successful in my application to study abroad at the University of Melbourne, Australia
for 1 semester of my undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>I spent July 2014-November 2014 studying at the university and seeing what Melbourne had 
to offer (a lot!). I then travelled throughout Australia and New Zealand from December 2014
- January 2015.</p>

<p><strong><em>More coming soon</em></strong></p>
