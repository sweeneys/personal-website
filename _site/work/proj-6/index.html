<p>I was awarded an All Ireland Scholarship on the basis of my exam results up to entering 
university.</p>

<p>The scholarship aims to reward students who have shown determination to reach high
academic achievements despite coming from underdeveloped socio-economic areas.</p>

<p>I am from a very rural area near the very northern tip of Ireland with very poor infrastructure
and a real shortage of investment.</p>
