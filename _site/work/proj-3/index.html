<p>Over the summer of 2013 I participated in an undergraduate,
interdisciplinary research project with 20 other students from universities throughout
Ireland.</p>

<p>The group researched issues relating to the <em>Smart Grid</em>.</p>

<p>I was involved in research, data analysis, report writing, presentations and finance.</p>

<p>We published a report “Participating in Ireland’s Smart Energy Future” which outlined
our main recommendations which can be found on our <a href="http://eni.ucd.ie/?page_id=36" target="_blank">website</a></p>

<p><strong><em>More coming soon</em></strong></p>
