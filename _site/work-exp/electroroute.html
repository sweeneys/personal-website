    <strong>When</strong>: June 2015 - August 2015 <br>
    <strong>Role</strong>: Intern at ElectroRoute <br>
    <strong>Where</strong>: Dublin, Ireland <br>
    <strong>What</strong>: • Developed (as part of a team) a random-forest (AI) model to predict day-ahead 
    wholesale electricity price. The model used predicted weather data, historic availability and historic 
    prices as inputs. <br>
    • Wrangled with time series data which included pulling data from multiple sources, storing it, 
    processing it.<br>
    • Developed a model to predict capacity payments (availability payments) for Irish generating 
    stations that was basically a stack model with some inputs modelled / predicted to try to solve a 
    complex equation.<br>
    • Developed interfaces (NVD3 charts) using PHP, HTML, CSS etc. to pull model output from database 
    and create visualisations for trading team to use as tools.<br>
    • All of these models were used as a basis for our trading team to make decisions about whether 
    energy should be imported or exported over the EWIC and Moyle interconnectors between the UK and 
    Ireland. <br>
    • I was nominated for a quarterly company excellence award for my work on these models.
