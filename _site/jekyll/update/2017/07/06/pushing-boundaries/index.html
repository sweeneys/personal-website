    <p>Some poems that I wrote recently which all fall under the theme of “pushing boundaries”.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>Chasing</strong></p>

<p>Chasing, always chasing, a dog <br />
and his tail, circles, no, <br />
not circles, straight lines, and <br />
curvy lines, but trending upwards, <br />
seemingly stochastically, dips <br />
and troughs, functions, filters, <br />
dark glasses and bright glasses, <br />
colourful, flamboyant even. The <br />
negatives, the circles, the tails, the <br />
vultures, who try, to hold you back; <br />
walk, they walk in circles, chasing <br />
tails they can never catch, your tail, <br />
you move it fast, you change direction. <br />
They cannot catch you, you’re <br />
fast, and smart, and chased and<br />
desperate.<br />
But reaching, forwards, upwards.<br />
Trending up, new dogs, <br />
chasing circles, positive signs, negative <br />
cosigns, negative signs, positive cosigns, <br />
changing quadrants, chasing, you. <br />
Jealousy, hypocrisy, unfulfilment. Why. <br />
If they hesitate, you should stop, pause, and <br />
help them, break out of the infinite <br />
circle, show them the negatives, the positives, <br />
stay on the positives, filter the negatives, a parabola! <br />
Shifting trajectories, to infinity, together. Stronger, <br />
reinforced, energised, together.</p>

<p><strong>Subscribed</strong></p>

<p>Subscribed, to a set of <br />
beliefs, a mission <br />
statement, commandments, <br />
Rules, that thou must <br />
obey, or else. The rules, <br />
superceding the thoughts, <br />
after all, the rules came <br />
first, they are established, <br />
they must be right, surely?</p>

<p>Tolerance, for thoughts,<br />
beyond the rules, is bounded, <br />
or else. On the surface, <br />
accepted, but, if thoughts <br />
develop, that contradict the <br />
rules, or worse, endanger them, the <br />
thoughts must be crushed.</p>

<p>Consequences are established, <br />
to control the thoughts, to <br />
ensure, that the rules prevail. <br />
The fires of hell threaten, <br />
prison threatens, social <br />
conscience threatens. In a <br />
world, where no rules exist, <br />
there is anarchy, people, and <br />
things, unsubscribed to a <br />
set of commandments, of value <br />
statements, of rules. Murder, <br />
swearing and violence, evil runs <br />
rampant. Sexualities, expressed; <br />
thoughts, free; bellies, full; <br />
identities, questioned; sleep-ins <br />
on Sundays, or early mornings <br />
to watch the sunrise, to indulge,<br />
not guilty. But free, to choose, <br />
to wander, to express, to push. <br />
Hopefully, to help, to engage and <br />
to love. Hopefully not to murder, <br />
maybe some rules are useful.</p>

<p><strong>Full Notebooks</strong></p>

<p>Full notebooks, empty pockets, <br />
racing minds, passing trains, <br />
adolescents running, for the <br />
train, they make it. Thoughts, <br />
sights, smells, captured, in <br />
notebooks, forever, until, the <br />
notebook is full, and then <br />
the thoughts, running, racing,<br />
free, uncaptured, undocumented, <br />
forgotten. Ink on paper, blue <br />
ink, blue trains, and green.</p>

<p>Passing, passing, gone. The thoughts <br />
remain, etched in ink, captured. <br />
The mind racing, thoughts, that want, <br />
to be, set free, but we don’t let <br />
them, or I don’t let them, I <br />
keep writing, sensibly, it helps me.</p>

<p>Organised, by virtue of their existence. No<br />
longer free, captured, in ink, <br />
but stuck? The thoughts, live <br />
on, only captured, for a moment <br />
in ink, the train is moving, to <br />
the next station, the next stop, <br />
the next notebook, and then, <br />
free again, to roam, to race, <br />
to wander, to discover. The man <br />
next to me, does not write in <br />
a notebook, but rather, he reads, <br />
a newspaper, absorbing the <br />
thoughts of others, that were <br />
captured, in a moment, now <br />
outdated, by who knows how <br />
many stations. But the facts, <br />
can never change, or can they? <br />
Keep reading, find out more, <br />
thinking, about the thoughts, the <br />
time they were captured, not <br />
letting them become your own, <br />
but rather, letting them help you, <br />
and your thoughts, to develop,<br />
to run faster, to be more free.</p>

<p>I’m on the train now. I’m moving <br />
with my thoughts, in sync, to the <br />
next station, and onwards.</p>

<p><strong>Gravity</strong></p>

<p>Gravity pushes downwards, <br />
to earth, with force, <br />
poorly understood, but <br />
helpful, a constant, well, <br />
almost. Depressing us, <br />
limiting us, protecting us.</p>

<p>Vertical limitations, but <br />
horizontal is free!<br />
Surely, that’s enough. To wander, <br />
in two dimensions, infinitely, <br />
but not quite. Infinitely, <br />
we circle, eventually, we <br />
are back where we started, <br />
where we have seen once <br />
before, maybe more. But <br />
vertically, we are, unlimited!</p>

<p>Infinitely unlimited, lost <br />
in space and time, anonymous. <br />
Unknown trajectories, unknown <br />
futures, unknown gravities, and <br />
maybe, if we travel far enough, <br />
no gravity, no depression, <br />
no limits, no protection, <br />
finally free! But more <br />
vulnerable than ever, infinitely <br />
lost, infinitely unknown, <br />
infinitely alone. Infinitesimally, <br />
at one point, we could have turned <br />
back, to known gravity, to home, <br />
to abandon new heights, <br />
to settle, to age, to protect <br />
someone else.</p>

<p><strong>Heights</strong></p>

<p>Defined by sea level, <br />
the moving, roaring alive <br />
sea, that defines, the <br />
heights, that we are. <br />
Ebbs, crashes, falls, <br />
smashing rocks, alive. <br />
Roaring, angry, tall, and <br />
growing. Fed, by the land, <br />
and then the air, fed by us, <br />
at heights defined by the sea. <br />
Flames, burning, in our <br />
engines, in our homes, in our <br />
factories. Fire, fed by land, <br />
and dinosaurs. Feeding <br />
the air, feeding the sea, <br />
defining new heights, <br />
for the sea, and then for <br />
the land, positive feedback, <br />
terrifying, unstoppable, <br />
or is it?</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight</strong></p>

<p>Sunlight, from the sky, all around me, <br />
I see, at the station. <br />
Responsible for all of the life, <br />
and eventually all of the death. <br />
The death, in the land, that we <br />
use to live, is unsustainable. <br />
Feeding life with death is, <br />
foolish, damaging, damaging to <br />
life. Sunlight is life, feeding <br />
life with life is positive, uplifting,<br />
alive. Death fires in our homes <br />
must be extinguished, if we are, <br />
to live, to flourish. Our lives, <br />
fed by life, can then feed, <br />
the air, the land, the oceans, <br />
all that we know, giving. No longer <br />
taking. The oceans settle, satisfied, <br />
eating life, and not death, as <br />
before. The new heights, are now reached <br />
by us, fed by life.</p>

<p><strong>Pushing</strong></p>

<p>Pushing, walking, wavering, <br />
getting through, to you. Through <br />
the people, the crowd, the gaps,<br />
the light. Dancing, side-to-side, <br />
enabled. Through. An objective, <br />
in mind, reaching, always. A goal, <br />
a long-term goal, pushing through <br />
the people, stepping over them, <br />
on them, bones breaking. Squashing, <br />
squirming, underneath. You stand <br />
triumphant, over them all. Standing <br />
tall, your objective reached. Your <br />
goal scored. But at what cost?</p>

<p>The cost of pushing, the price, <br />
the boundaries pushed, further <br />
than ever before, learning, <br />
further than you’ve ever been <br />
before, but what about me? <br />
And them? What’s the cost?</p>

<p>The cost to the disabled? Those <br />
that waited, hesitant, those that <br />
did not push, those that let you <br />
through, the disabled that <br />
enabled you, did they get what <br />
they deserved? or wanted? Pushed, <br />
to let you through, so you could <br />
see the light.</p>

<p>Your family, your friends, the people <br />
in the crowd, who are, content, or disabled? <br />
Don’t forget them, those that enabled you, <br />
they’re happy, and happy for you, are you?</p>
