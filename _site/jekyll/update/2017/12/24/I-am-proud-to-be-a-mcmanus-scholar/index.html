  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>On Wednesday 20th December 2017, the McManus scholars were invited to the Dean Hotel on Harcourt Street in Dublin for an alumni networking event.</p>

<p>To give some background, receiving the McManus scholarship is the thing that I point to as the pivotal moment which completely and dramatically changed my whole life. <!--more--> I was awarded this scholarship in 2012 after I was deemed to be one of the highest-achieving students in Ireland to come from a disadvantaged socio-economic background.</p>

<p>The scholarship primarily meant that all worries I had about going to university (…financial) were solved. Below I am listing some of the things that I have achieved that I directly associate with the financial freedom that the McManus scholarship awarded to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Studying abroad at the University of Melbourne in Australia from July 2014 - January 2015 (one of the greatest learning experiences of my life to date)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completing one professional summer internship every summer from 2012-2016</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being able to concentrate on reaching my full academic potential during my time in university</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting my first company when still in university as part of a European team</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being able to save money to immediately progress to completing my Masters degree</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover from all of this, the principal benefit the McManus scholarship gave to me was my time. Time to focus on personal and professional development. I had the opportunity to get really involved in the social aspects of university, including nights out, class trips, societies, music festivals, road trips and holidays abroad. This was a very different life for me compared to pre-McManus scholarship. I am a very different person now than I was when I started university in 2012. These experiences have helped me get to the point where I am now, where I feel inspired to make a difference to the world and truly believe that I can and will. Most pressingly, I am actively working to contribute to solving some of the big energy challenges that the world is facing.</p>

<p>Des Cahill was the MC on the night, with speeches from scholarship-trustee Roger Downer, previous scholarship winners and guest-of-honour Irish professional golfer Padraig Harrington. As someone with a terrible attention span, I was shocked at how I was able to hang onto every word of the speeches.</p>

<p>Roger gave us all a massive confidence boost (it was literally a therapy session, highly recommended), and then set us to work. The task that he gave us was to do our bit to help in the promotion of the profile and name of the scholarship. This is why I am writing this blog. I have always been proud to be a McManus scholar with the award taking pride of place on my CV but there is definitely more I can do to promote awareness of the scholarship.</p>

<p>Roger also emphasised the powerful global network of scholars that exists which we can make use of. Roger then gave us a final call to action - to give something back. He talked about how he is approaching the later years of his working career and how the concept of a <em>legacy</em> is worth careful consideration, what are we leaving behind? I think that JP McManus’ legacy where he has changed the lives of hundreds of students from disadvantaged backgrounds is an exceptional thing to leave behind. If I can do half as much good as he has I would consider that to be a successful legacy for me.</p>

<p>I also need to mention Padraig’s speech. To be honest, I never really pay too much attention to celebrity personalities and I have only ever heard Padraig talk in the context of a post-golf commentary. But his speech on Wednesday was excellent. It was: accessible, relatable, comical, informed and engaging from start to finish.</p>

<p>The central message from Padraig’s speech was to have enough self-confidence to play your own game in life. His approach to his professional golfing career revealed a mindset that is highly transferable to general life pursuits. Perfectly honed skills, belief in yourself and your own abilities and being able to drown out or rise above doubt from naysayers was proposed as a recipe for success. Stepping back, to emphasise that he was speaking to a room full of 18-28 year olds from disadvantaged, usually very rural countryside backgrounds where being a high academic achiever is not the norm, that message of staying true to yourself was very well-received.</p>

<p>As a final note, at the event on Wednesday I met some of the most interesting, happy, self-motivated, funny people who genuinely inspired me. The attitude in the room was one of infectious self-belief and desire to make a difference to the world. The typical getting-to-know-each-other process that people go through was dramatically accelerated and I walked away feeling like I had made several new friends for life. I look forward to exploring business and personal opportunities with my network of fellow <em>McManus scholars</em> for years to come.</p>
