  I made this site to show people some of the projects that I've worked on over the years 
  and also so I could post some blogs. I just started the site so I still have a bit more 
  work to do to get everything up and running.
  
  <p>
  Also - I'll be graduating next year with a Masters in Energy Systems Engineering from 
  University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland so I'm looking for opportunities for after 
  graduation.</p>

  I was building the site, I'll think of better ones...</p>
