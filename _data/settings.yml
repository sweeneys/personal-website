  **Welcome!**

blurb: >
  
  I'm Shaun! I'm 23 and I will graduate from University College Dublin, Ireland with a Masters degree
  in energy systems engineering in May 2017 and I'm really not sure what I want to do after that.
  I love to travel and meet new people, I love to get involved in very technical and detailed projects
  and I love to learn new things.  
  I also have an exemplary academic record (but that's boring).
  To get to know me a bit better, here is a list of things that I can do/I am interested in:

skills:
- {name: Energy and power systems, value: '8'}
- {name: Electrical transport, value: '5'}
- {name: Statistics and data science, value: '5'}
- {name: Programming, value: '7'}
- {name: Project and team leadership, value: '9'}
- {name: Work to achieve goals, value: '9'}
- {name: Attention to detail, value: '9'}
- {name: Communicate effectively, value: '8'}
- {name: Maths, value: '8'}
- {name: 'Smart cities, smart grids and policy', value: '7'}
- {name: Entrepreneurship / start-ups, value: '7'}
- {name: Control and optimisation, value: '6'}

  The logical thinker in me appreciates the ridiculousness of using a grading
  system like above to describe such general terms (what could I possibly mean that I am '8/10' at maths?).
  The truth is that I am interested in a wide variety of topics and I think
  I could give almost anything a go - I can provide one
  universal truth though which is that I love a challenge and I thrive on 
  responsibility. 
  

  If there is anything that you think I would be good at (job, PhD, graduate programme, start-up, 
  entrepreneurship / leadership programme), I would be really eager to discuss this with you.
  Also, I hope you like the site and please get in touch if there is anything
  else that you would like to know about me.
